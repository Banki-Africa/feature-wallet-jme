   *   <li>All superclasses must be implemented in Kotlin.
   *   <li>All properties must be public, protected, or internal.
   *   <li>All properties must be either non-transient or have a default value.

  /**
   * An optional custom generator tag used to indicate which generator should be used. If empty,
   * Moshi's annotation processor will generate an adapter for the annotated type. If not empty,
   * Moshi's processor will skip it and defer to a custom generator. This can be used to allow other
   * custom code generation tools to run and still allow Moshi to read their generated JsonAdapter
   * outputs.
   *
   * <p>Requirements for generated adapter class signatures:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The generated adapter must subclass {@link JsonAdapter} and be parameterized by this
   *       type.
   *   <li>{@link Types#generatedJsonAdapterName} should be used for the fully qualified class name
   *       in order for Moshi to correctly resolve and load the generated JsonAdapter.
   *   <li>The first parameter must be a {@link Moshi} instance.
   *   <li>If generic, a second {@link Type Type[]} parameter should be declared to accept type
   *       arguments.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Example for a class "CustomType":
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * class CustomTypeJsonAdapter(moshi: Moshi, types: Array<Type>) : JsonAdapter<CustomType>() {
   *   // ...
   * }
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>To help ensure your own generator meets requirements above, you can use Moshiâ€™s built-in
   * generator to create the API signature to get started, then make your own generator match that
   * expected signature.
